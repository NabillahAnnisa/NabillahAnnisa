Here is our research project using fetal cardiotocogram data which aims to compare 7 algorithms to predict the fetal health. 
The seven algorithms consist of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), XG Boost, 
Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Light GBM (LGBM) and Random Forest (RF).
